    <h1>Culinary Experience</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My culinary experience is largely based in the culinary arts program at my school. In this course students work in all stations in the kitchen (based on the brigade system) and prepare food that is served in the school's cafeteria. This class was a great opportunity for me to experience the atmosphere of a commercial kitchen, as opposed to cooking at home.

        <h1>Computer Science Experience</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>While I don't have much experience yet in Computer Sciences, I intend to study the subject in University. I am currently taking computer science at school to build a foundation for more advanced projects. Building this website was a great way to practice my basic HTML and CSS.
