        <p>These are some of the varieties of macarons I've made over the years. My favourite thing about macarons is that they're a blank canvas for hundreds of flavours. From left to right these macarons are: Coffee and Chocolate Hazelnut, S'mores, Cotton Candy, Chai, Chocolate Mint, and Hot Chocolate</p>

        <p>Making cakes and decorating them is something I really enjoy. I am still working on refining my decorating techniques and I have taken a few classes. I look forward to improving my abilities!</p>

        <p>These photos are all items I made in Culinary Arts class in our cafeteria's kitchen. On the left is a deep-fried poached egg with hollandaise that we made with our leftovers from breakfast that morning. In the center are taco salads I made while in the Garde-Manger station. The image to the right is tea sandwiches I made while in the Breakfast station.</p>
