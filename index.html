      <h1 class="center">About Me</h1>
      <div class="large-text-body">
      <p class="center">My name is Kaydence Riehl and I am a student in 10th grade in the French Immersion program
        at Harry Ainlay High School. I love learning languages and have excelled in my studies of
        french. I am taking several electives including Culinary Arts, an apprenticeship based course in
        which students get classroom and hands-on experience, as well as Computer Sciences class that focuses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="center">Baking has always been one of my passions. I have a particular fondness for making dishes of personal cultural significance such as Paska and Perogies. Baking Paska with my Grandma and my cousins during Easter is one of my favourite memories. I really enjoy making macarons as well. They are such a versatile little cookies that allow for many flavour variations</p>
        <p class="center">I also have quite a history with coding and computer sciences. In the fourth grade I did an online Java camp that focused on modding Minecraft and it drew me into the world of computer science. Then, in the eigth grade my science teacher, who also happened to teach CTS to the high school students did several Hour of Code activities with our class, mainly based in Python. I excelled at these activities and sped through them all. My teacher ended up sending an email home to my parents encouraging me to pursue computer science in high school, and here I am today!</p>
