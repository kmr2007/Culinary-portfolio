        <p class="center">Hangman was one of the first bigger projects I made. It has a singleplayer and a multiplayer mode. Building this project taught me a bit about altering strings in specific ways. It took a lot of googling and trying things out, but after a lot of perserverance I'm pretty happy with the result.

        <p class="center">I think that if I was to remake Tic Tac Toe now I could do a much better job, but I was very proud of the results at the time. It could be improved by using canvas elements instead of images on buttons for a more consistent look. However, making this project taught me a lot about variables.

        <p class="center">This website project helped a lot with forms and input. The assignment was to make a multipage website about one of our favourite things and include a quiz about said thing.
