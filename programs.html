        Hangman was one of the first bigger projects I made. It has a
        singleplayer and a multiplayer mode. Building this project taught me a
        bit about altering strings in specific ways. It took a lot of googling
        and trying things out, but after a lot of perserverance I'm pretty happy
        with the result. Click

        This dino game is based off of the offline Google Chrome mini game. The
        goal is to make it as far as possible without hitting an obstacle. This
        project was great to practice simple animation and character movement.

        This website project helped a lot with forms and input. The assignment
        was to make a multipage website about one of our favourite things and
        include a quiz about said thing. To take a look click
